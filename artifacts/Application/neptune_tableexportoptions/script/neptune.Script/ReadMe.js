Documentation:

The export functionality in this component is built on top of the library called "Table export" 
which has dependencies such as html2canvas, pdfmaker, filesaver, etc. 
You can learn more about this library by visiting the GitHub repository at https://github.com/hhurz/tableExport.jquery.plugin/.

This custom component allows you to export a table to various formats 
such as PDF, CSV, XLSX, and JSON. To make it work, you need to add a table name 
as seen in the JavaScript file using the following syntax: `$(tableName).tableExport({})`.

If you encounter any errors, make sure to check the responsivepopover to ensure it is correctly referenced.

For a better understanding of custom components and their usage, 
you can refer to the documentation at https://docs.neptune-software.com/neptune-dxp-open-edition/23/cockpit-overview/app-designer-custom-component.html.
